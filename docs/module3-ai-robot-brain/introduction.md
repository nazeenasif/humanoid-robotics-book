# Introduction to AI-Powered Robot Brains

## The Need for AI in Humanoid Robotics

Humanoid robots operate in complex, dynamic environments that require sophisticated perception, decision-making, and control capabilities. Traditional rule-based approaches are insufficient for handling the uncertainty and variability of real-world scenarios. AI-powered robot brains enable humanoid robots to perceive their environment, make intelligent decisions, and execute complex tasks with minimal human intervention.

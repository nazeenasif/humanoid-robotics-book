# Research Findings: Humanoid Robotics Book Creation

**Feature Branch**: `1-readme-spec-creation` | **Date**: 2025-12-04

## Summary

This document outlines the ongoing research approach for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" book, following the Research Phase defined in the implementation plan. Research will be conducted concurrently with content creation, focusing on verifying factual claims and collecting APA-formatted citations.

## Research Phase Goals (from Plan.md)

- **Goal**: Gather all necessary background information, verify factual claims, and collect APA-formatted citations for each chapter/module.
- **Deliverables**: Comprehensive `research.md` (for each chapter/module), `/references/` directory with validated sources.
- **Checkpoints**: All factual claims supported by at least two credible sources; 50%+ peer-reviewed sources identified.

## Current Research Tasks (from Tasks.md - Phase 1)

- [ ] T001 Conduct initial broad research on ROS 2 fundamentals for `docs/module1-ros2/introduction.md`
- [ ] T002 Identify peer-reviewed sources for ROS 2 concepts and store in `/references/ros2.md`
- [ ] T003 Conduct initial broad research on Gazebo and Unity digital twin concepts for `docs/module2-digital-twin/introduction.md`
- [ ] T004 Identify peer-reviewed sources for digital twin concepts and store in `/references/digital-twin.md`
- [ ] T005 Conduct initial broad research on NVIDIA Isaac Sim, VSLAM, and Nav2 for `docs/module3-ai-robot-brain/introduction.md`
- [ ] T006 Identify peer-reviewed sources for AI-robot brain concepts and store in `/references/ai-robot-brain.md`
- [ ] T007 Conduct initial broad research on LLM-VLA integration and OpenAI Whisper for `docs/module4-vla/introduction.md`
- [ ] T008 Identify peer-reviewed sources for VLA concepts and store in `/references/vla.md`
- [ ] T009 Create `references/` directory for storing APA-style citations

## Resolved Clarifications (from Previous Planning)

- **Language/Version**: Resolved by specifying Python 3.x and JavaScript/TypeScript.
- **Primary Dependencies**: Resolved by listing key technologies and their expected versions (e.g., ROS 2 Humble/Iron, Gazebo, Unity, NVIDIA Isaac Sim, OpenAI Whisper, Docusaurus v3).
- **Testing**: Resolved by defining testing scope as verification of code examples, exercises, Docusaurus build process, and conceptual content accuracy.
- **Performance Goals**: Resolved by setting performance goals for Docusaurus build times and website responsiveness.
